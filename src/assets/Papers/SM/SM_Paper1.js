<b>Overall explanation</b>
Correct option:

For Amazon CloudFront, you use key pairs to create signed URLs for private content, such as when you want to distribute restricted content that someone paid for.

<b>CloudFront Key Pairs</b> - IAM users can't create CloudFront key pairs. You must log in using root credentials to create key pairs.

To create signed URLs or signed cookies, you need a signer. A signer is either a trusted key group that you create in CloudFront, or an AWS account that contains a CloudFront key pair. AWS recommends that you use trusted key groups with signed URLs and signed cookies instead of using CloudFront key pairs.

Incorrect options:

<b>EC2 Instance Key Pairs</b> - You use key pairs to access Amazon EC2 instances, such as when you use SSH to log in to a Linux instance. These key pairs can be created from the IAM user login and do not need root user access.

<b>IAM User Access Keys</b> - Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID and a secret access key. You use access keys to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS if you use AWS CLI commands (using the SDKs) or using AWS API operations. IAM users can create their own Access Keys, does not need root access.

<b>IAM User passwords</b> - Every IAM user has access to his own credentials and can reset the password whenever they need to.

<b>Overall explanation</b>

Correct option:

<b>Dedicated Instances</b> - Dedicated Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer. Dedicated Instances that belong to different AWS accounts are physically isolated at a hardware level, even if those accounts are linked to a single-payer account. However, Dedicated Instances may share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that are not Dedicated Instances.

A Dedicated Host is also a physical server that's dedicated for your use. With a Dedicated Host, you have visibility and control over how instances are placed on the server.

Differences between Dedicated Hosts and Dedicated Instances:

Incorrect options:

<b>Spot Instances</b> - A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Your Spot Instance runs whenever capacity is available and the maximum price per hour for your request exceeds the Spot price. Any instance present with unused capacity will be allocated. Even though this is cost-effective, it does not fulfill the single-tenant hardware requirement of the client and hence is not the correct option.

<b>Dedicated Hosts</b> - An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use. Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your existing software licenses on EC2 instances. With a Dedicated Host, you have visibility and control over how instances are placed on the server. This option is costlier than the Dedicated Instance and hence is not the right choice for the current requirement.

<b>On-Demand Instances</b> - With On-Demand Instances, you pay for compute capacity by the second with no long-term commitments. You have full control over its lifecycle—you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. Hardware isolation is not possible and on-demand has one of the costliest instance charges and hence is not the correct answer for current requirements.

    explanation: `
<b>Overall explanation</b>
Correct option:

<b>Enable CodeBuild timeouts</b>

A build represents a set of actions performed by AWS CodeBuild to create output artifacts (for example, a JAR file) based on a set of input artifacts (for example, a collection of Java class files).

The following rules apply when you run multiple builds:

When possible, builds run concurrently. The maximum number of concurrently running builds can vary.

Builds are queued if the number of concurrently running builds reaches its limit. The maximum number of builds in a queue is five times the concurrent build limit.

A build in a queue that does not start after the number of minutes specified in its time out value is removed from the queue. The default timeout value is eight hours. You can override the build queue timeout with a value between five minutes and eight hours when you run your build.

By setting the timeout configuration, the build process will automatically terminate post the expiry of the configured timeout.

Incorrect options:

<b>Use AWS Lambda</b> - AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume. Lambda cannot be used to impact the code build process.

<b>Use Amazon CloudWatch</b> - Amazon CloudWatch allows you to monitor AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS. Metrics are provided automatically for a number of AWS products and services. CloudWatch is good for monitoring and viewing logs. CloudWatch cannot be used to impact the code build process.

<b>Use VPC Flow Logs</b> - VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC but not for code compiling configuration. VPC Flow Logs cannot be used to impact the code build process.

<b>Overall explanation</b>
Correct option:

<b>Security Groups are stateful, so allowing inbound traffic to the necessary ports enables the connection. Network ACLs are stateless, so you must allow both inbound and outbound traffic</b> - Security groups are stateful, so allowing inbound traffic to the necessary ports enables the connection. Network ACLs are stateless, so you must allow both inbound and outbound traffic.

To enable the connection to a service running on an instance, the associated network ACL must allow both inbound traffic on the port that the service is listening on as well as allow outbound traffic from ephemeral ports. When a client connects to a server, a random port from the ephemeral port range (1024-65535) becomes the client's source port.

The designated ephemeral port then becomes the destination port for return traffic from the service, so outbound traffic from the ephemeral port must be allowed in the network ACL.

By default, network ACLs allow all inbound and outbound traffic. If your network ACL is more restrictive, then you need to explicitly allow traffic from the ephemeral port range.

If you accept traffic from the internet, then you also must establish a route through an internet gateway. If you accept traffic over VPN or AWS Direct Connect, then you must establish a route through a virtual private gateway.

Incorrect options:

<b>Network ACLs are stateful, so allowing inbound traffic to the necessary ports enables the connection. Security Groups are stateless, so you must allow both inbound and outbound traffic</b> - This is incorrect as already discussed.

<b>IAM Role defined in the Security Group is different from the IAM Role that is given access in the Network ACLs</b> - This is a made-up option and just added as a distractor.

<b>Rules associated with Network ACLs should never be modified from the command line. An attempt to modify rules from the command line blocks the rule and results in an erratic behavior</b> - This option is a distractor. AWS does not support modifying rules of Network ACLs from the command line tool.
